## Homework for the week of June 13th, 2022
**Using dictionary data structures in Python**

This week, we practice manipulating dictionary data structures, with a program that stores names and ages.

### Starter Code
You are provided with a simple Python program that initializes an empty *dictionary* data structure called NamesDictionary.

The Starter code implements an endless loop.

First, a menu is displayed with several options. The user can select options to add a name to the dictionary, or view all of the data in the dictionary, or quit the program.

*dictionary* data structures in Python, are denoted by curly brackets:

    NamesDictionary = {} # Initalize an empty dictionary data structure called NamesDictionary
### Homework
Using your Python knowledge, add features to the menu, and the program, to perform the following operations:

(C)alculate the number of names in the dictionary

(D)elete a name from the dictionary, by asking the user what name to delete, then finding, and deleting the name. An error message should be returned if the name typed does not exist in the dictionary.

####Extra credit

Modify the entire program to work inside a GUI window, with **tkinter**. (Don't worry about doing this, if any part of this week's assignment was difficult for you.)
