dictionary data structure exercise

Python for beginners class homework using dictionary data structures.
Extra credit for putting in ina GUI with tkinter.

Not intended to be a useful product as the workflow is mimicking the 
CLI version, using the same menu driven function calls that perform

with a more ergonomic GUI while not using the dictionary data structure, but instead 
updating a tkinter listbox.
