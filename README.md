# DictionaryData
### dictionary data structure exercise

Python for beginners class homework using dictionary data structures.
Extra credit for putting it in a GUI with tkinter.

Includes instructions and starter code of original assignment as well as the 
basic CLI version of the project

Not intended to be a useful product as the workflow is mimicking the 
CLI version, using the same menu-driven function calls that perform 
actions on a dictionary data structure. A similar function can be achieved 
with a more ergonomic GUI while not using the dictionary data structure, but instead 
updating a tkinter listbox. The project presented 
some interesting challenges around the expansion of the amount of data 
and how to display it.
